# Titanic-ML-Classification-and-Data-Analysis
End-to-end Titanic dataset project including data cleaning, feature engineering, outlier handling, and machine learning classification using Python (Colab)


This repository contains a complete Machine Learning classification project on the Titanic dataset.
The analysis focuses on:

Data cleaning (handling missing values, dropping irrelevant columns)

Outlier detection and removal using the IQR method

Text-based feature extraction (Titles, Ticket prefixes, etc.)

Categorical data consolidation (rare value grouping)

Preparing clean data for ML model training

The notebook was built and executed on Google Colab, showcasing best practices in data preprocessing and feature engineering for classification problems.

Libraries Used:
pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, re, PIL

Future Work:

Model building and evaluation (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)

Visualization and Power BI integration for insights
